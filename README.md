# javacore-book-management
 
## Introduction 

This project is a Funix Assignment that required me to use Java Core to make a Book Management System

## Version

- It is written by using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.2.3 x64
- JDK 11 

## How to use

- Run the Main inside the “src” folder

## Special Note

- I have purposely added many more Exception handling than Funix requirement and for good
reasons . However , I may not able to handle all cases
- I also make a lot more interface for exception handling and the need to make my code
maintainable (lesson learned from my previous assignment)
- My project try to implement SOLID principal however most of the time it was the “S” and “O” . My design
pattern is not good enough so the “L” , “I” and “D” cannot be implemented properly
- For advance requirement:
    - Sort the books list by code or by Price(using quicksort)
    - Load or save the file. Ask for confirm for overwrite save or overwrite load
    - The save and load from a file call “book.txt”
- For Quick Sort I must confess that due to the algorithms complexity , I had to reference code
from both my old self and others from link bellow:

- Some custom Exceptions were made for better exception handling
